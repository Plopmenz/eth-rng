## ETH RNG

Uses Ethereum transaction hashes after a certain block to generate random numbers. This prevents the entities from manipulating the "random" numbers according to their taste (e.g. picking numbers or running modified software on a live stream). A reasonable starting block should be chosen, if a random one is picked (after the blocks have been mined), it does allow the entity limited influence.
